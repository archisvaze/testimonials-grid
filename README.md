## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
